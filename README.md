# Introduction

Welcome to my README!

I'm thrilled to announce that I'm currently undertaking the Piscine at 42KL, a journey that began back in March 2023. I'm excited to share my progress, experiences, and insights with you as I take on this challenge. 

Let's get started!

## Chapter I

### Instructions

• Only this page will serve as reference; do not trust rumors.

• Watch out! This document could potentially change up to an hour before submission.

• These exercises are carefully laid out by order of difficulty - from easiest to hardest.
We will not take into account a successfully completed harder exercise if an easier
one is not perfectly functional.

• Make sure you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.

• You have to follow the submission procedures for every exercise.

• Your exercises will be checked and graded by your fellow classmates.

• On top of that, your exercises will be checked and graded by a program called
Moulinette.

• Moulinette is very meticulous and strict in its evaluation of your work. It is entirely
automated and there is no way to negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad
surprises, be as thorough as possible.

• Exercises in Shell must be executable with */bin/sh.*

• You cannot leave any additional file in your directory than those specified in the
subject.

• Got a question? Ask your peer on the right. Otherwise, try your peer on the left.

• Your reference guide is called Google / man / the Internet / ....

• Examine the examples thoroughly. They could very well call for details that are
not explicitly mentioned in the subject...

# Chapter XIII

### Submission and peer-evaluation

* Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the names of your files to ensure they are correct.

```
You need to return only the files requested by the subject of this
project.
```
