|               Exercise 09             |
|---------------------------------------|
|                           |
| Turn-in directory : ex09/				|
| Files to turn in : ft_magic			|
| Allowed functions : None				|
| Notes : n/a							|

### TODO

*  Create a magic file called ft_magic that will be formatted appropriately to detect
files of 42 file type, built with a "42" string at the 42nd byte #

```
man file
```

## Lessons Learned

I got stuck here for quite some time, and Im not even being evaluated yet, so what I did is basically just create 
the ft_magic files, then wrote words until the bytes reach 41, at 42nd bytes I put in 42, so lets see if this is
correct or not, will update later
