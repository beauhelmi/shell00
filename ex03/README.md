# Chapter VI
## Exercise 03 : SSH me!

|               Exercise 03             |
|---------------------------------------|
|               SSH Key             |
| Turn-in directory : ex03/				|
| Files to turn in : id_rsa_pub			|
| Allowed functions : None				|
| Notes : n/a							|

### TODO

*  Create your own SSH key. Once it is done:
*   Add your public key to your repository, in a file name id_rsa_pub

*   Update your ssh key on the intranet. This will allow you to push the repository to our git server.
```
The fileâ€™s name was not chosen randomly.

Make sure you understand the difference between the public key and
the private key.
