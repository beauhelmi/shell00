## Exercise 08 : clean

|               Exercise 08             |
|---------------------------------------|
|                           |
| Turn-in directory : ex08/				|
| Files to turn in : clean			|
| Allowed functions : None				|
| Notes : n/a							|

### TODO

*  In a file called clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the
current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a
name that start and end by #

* The command line will show and erase all files found.

* Only one command is allowed: no ’;’ or ’&&’ or other shenanigans.

```
man find
```
