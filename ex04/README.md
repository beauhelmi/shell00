### TODO

* In a midLS file, place the command line that will list all files and directories in your
current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that
includes double-dots), separated by a comma and a space, by order of modification
date. Make sure the directory’s names are followed by a slash character.

```
What has not been asked for should not be done!
